
# THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE IN THIS FILE!
# -  Add more variables if needed - look into the presentation to see if some are needed
# -  Change the orientation of the variables, maybe the current state is fine - idk
# -  Redo all of the other files such that all variables are taken from here (import this file etc...)
# - Make it fancy and nice - idk, it seems really dark and sad here, maybe colors? Idk
